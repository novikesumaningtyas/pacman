# Pacman Simulator
Pacman Simulator for IE Digital Coding Challenge
<br>
<br>Maven Project
<br>Language : Java
<br>IDEA : IntelliJ
<br>
<br>This is the code for Pacman Simulator from IE Digital Coding Challenge https://github.com/ie/Code-Challenge-1
<br>
<br>This Pacman simulator needs user interaction for running the simulator.
<br>I also add test cases (pacman/src/test) for Pacman class and the Control class and using example 3 from the coding challenge as the test case. 
<br>
<br> After download the project, install the dependencies for the project
<br> then running the Main Class (pacman/src/main/java/Main) to start the simulation
