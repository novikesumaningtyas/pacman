# Pacman Simulator
Pacman Simulator for IE Digital Coding Challenge

Maven Project
Language : Java
IDEA : IntelliJ

This is the code for Pacman Simulator from IE Digital Coding Challenge https://github.com/ie/Code-Challenge-1

This Pacman simulator needs user interaction for running the simulator.
I also add test cases for Pacman class and the Control class and using example 3 from the coding challenge as the test case.
